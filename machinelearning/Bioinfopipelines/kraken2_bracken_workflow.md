Kraken2 and Bracken Classification Workflow
This document outlines the steps I followed to process three metagenomic samples using Kraken2 and Bracken. The samples are:
•	ERR14218891
•	ERR14218664
•	ERR14219004
Each sample was classified using Kraken2, and abundance estimation was refined with Bracken. I also extracted the classified and unclassified reads.
